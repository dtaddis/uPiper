## Installation

### Via Unity Package Manager (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Install Package
1. Open `Window > Package Manager` in Unity Editor
2. Click `+` button and select `Add package from git URL...`
3. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/ayutaz/uPiper.git?path=Assets/uPiper
   ```

#### Step 2: Import Required Data

After installing from Package Manager, **you must import the data following these steps**:

1. **Select "In Project" in Package Manager**
2. **Select the "uPiper" package**
3. **Expand the "Samples" section**
4. **Import the following samples**:
   - 📚 **OpenJTalk Dictionary Data** (Required) - Dictionary for Japanese speech synthesis
   - 📚 **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary** (Required) - Dictionary for English speech synthesis
   - 🎤 **Voice Models** (Recommended) - High-quality voice models
   - 🎮 **Basic TTS Demo** (Optional) - Demo scene

#### Step 3: Setup Data

After importing samples:

1. **Run `uPiper > Setup > Install from Samples` from the menu**
2. Click "Install" in the installation dialog
3. Wait for setup to complete

#### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. **Run `uPiper > Setup > Check Setup Status` from the menu**
2. Confirm all items show "✓ Installed"
3. Open the Basic TTS Demo scene to verify functionality

> ⚠️ **Important**: TTS functionality will not work without importing the dictionary data

### From Package Files
Download the latest package from [Releases](https://github.com/ayutaz/uPiper/releases):
- **Unity Package (.unitypackage)**: Legacy format, compatible with all Unity versions
- **UPM Package (.tgz)**: For Unity Package Manager, Unity 2019.3+

### Troubleshooting

#### Only One Sample Appears
- Restart Unity Editor
- Click "Refresh" button in Package Manager

#### Dictionary Files Not Found Error
- Confirm `uPiper > Setup > Install from Samples` was executed
- Check status with `uPiper > Setup > Check Setup Status`

#### Japanese Text Garbled
- Use the NotoSansJP-Regular SDF font included in Basic TTS Demo

## Supported Platforms

### Currently Supported
- ✅ Windows (x64)
- ✅ macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel)
- ✅ Linux (x64)
- ✅ Android (ARM64/ARMv7/x86/x86_64)
- ✅ iOS (ARM64, iOS 11.0+) - **NEW!**

### In Development
- 🚧 WebGL - Implementation plan completed ([Issue #62](https://github.com/ayutaz/uPiper/issues/62))
  - Unity.InferenceEngine WebGL support confirmed
  - Planning on-demand resource loading to bypass 100MB limit
  - Details: [WebGL Implementation Strategy](docs/webgl-implementation-strategy.md)

## Build and Package Creation

### Automated Build (GitHub Actions)
- All platform builds are automatically executed when pushing to the main branch
- Creating a release tag (v*) will automatically create releases and packages

### Package Export (For Developers)
Create packages manually from Unity Editor:
1. `uPiper/Package/Export Unity Package (.unitypackage)` - Legacy format
2. `uPiper/Package/Export UPM Package (.tgz)` - Unity Package Manager format
3. `uPiper/Package/Export Both Formats` - Export both formats simultaneously

## GPU Inference

uPiper supports GPU inference for faster speech generation:

```csharp
var config = new PiperConfig
{
    Backend = InferenceBackend.Auto,  // Auto selection
    AllowFallbackToCPU = true,        // CPU fallback on GPU failure
    GPUSettings = new GPUInferenceSettings
    {
        MaxBatchSize = 4,
        UseFloat16 = true,
        MaxMemoryMB = 512
    }
};
```

See the [GPU Inference Guide](docs/features/gpu/gpu-inference.md) for details.
